# Sales Cafe Cleaning Project using SQL

This project focuses on cleaning raw sales data from a cafe in preparation for analysis. The data consisted of missing values and inconsistencies.

## Data

- `dirty_cafe_sales.csv`: Raw input data
- `cleaned_cafe_sales.csv`: Cleaned and processed data

## Code used

The SQL code (`cafe sales project.sql`) was used to clean and perform analysis on the data.

## Tools used

- MySQL 

## Cleaning Process

Steps I took to clean the raw data:

1. **Inspected and viewed the data**
2. **Checked for duplicates** – Identified if there were any duplicate transactions present. No rows were removed to ensure key metrics such as revenue remains accurate and reliable.
3. **Fix `Total Spent` column** – Found missing and incorrect values in the `Total Spent` column. Created a new column total_spent_new to store corrected values, then proceeded to update the `Total Spent` column. 
4. **Standardising values** – "ERROR" and "UNKNOWN" values were standardized by replacing both with "UNKNOWN"  to ensure consistency and reduce the number of unique categories.

   
## Insights

1. Identified the most and least popular items based on quantity sold, along with the total revenue generated by each product.
2. Calculated the overall total revenue across all transactions.
3. Analyzed monthly revenue to understand sales trends over time.
4. Compared revenue by location and order type (in-store vs. takeaway).
5. Assessed the number of items sold and total revenue for each day of the week to identify patterns in daily sales performance.
